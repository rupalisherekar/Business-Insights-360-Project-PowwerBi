# Business Insihts 360 - PowerBI|Sql|Excel


## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly and they still rely on excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also due to the lack of effective analytics the company faced a major loss in Latin America.
As a strategic move, Senior executives of this company have decided to invest in a data analytics project and have assigned a team for this work.
I have created Power BI dashboard that's I called Business Insights 360 to fulfil the demands of the Product Owner and the stakeholders. This was a part of the Data Analytics Boot Camp By Code Basics.This dashboard provides insights to the business with 5 different perspectives
